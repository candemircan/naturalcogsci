### Abstract

> Humans represent scenes and objects in rich feature spaces, carrying information that allows us to generalise about category memberships and abstract functions with few examples. What determines whether a neural network model generalises like a human? We tested how well the representations of $86$ pretrained neural network models mapped to human learning trajectories across two tasks where humans had to learn continuous relationships and categories of natural images. In these tasks, both human participants and neural networks successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalisation. We found that while training dataset size was a core determinant of alignment with human choices, contrastive training with multi-modal data (text and imagery) was a common feature of currently publicly available models that predicted human generalisation. Intrinsic dimensionality of representations had different effects on alignment for different model types. Lastly, we tested three sets of human-aligned representations and found no consistent improvements in predictive accuracy compared to the baselines. In conclusion, pretrained neural networks can serve to extract representations for cognitive models, as they appear to capture some fundamental aspects of cognition that are transferable across tasks. Both our paradigms and modelling approach offer a novel way to quantify alignment between neural networks and humans and extend cognitive science into more naturalistic domains.

## Setup

You can install the Python & R dependencies as follows:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/candemircan/naturalcogsci.git
cd naturalcogsci
pip install .
Rscript bin/install_packages.R
```

The code was tested on Python 3.9 and R 4.3

## Environment Variables

The code uses the environment variable `NATURALCOGSCI_ROOT` to determine
the root directory of the project. You can set this variable in your
`.bashrc` file (or whatever your shell rc file might be) as follows:

``` bash
export NATURALCOGSCI_ROOT=/path/to/naturalcogsci
```

For me, R could not read this variable from the shell, so I had to set
it in the `~/.Renviron` file as well as follows:

``` bash
NATURALCOGSCI_ROOT=/path/to/naturalcogsci
```

## Experiments

Both experiments are shared under the `experiments` folder. See the
`README.md` files in the respective folders for more information.

## Stimuli

If you want to extract the features from the images , you need to
download the THINGS database under the `stimuli` folder.

This can be done from the following link:

<https://things-initiative.org/uploads/THINGS/images.zip>

## Data

The data is shared in an OSF repository. It should be put under the
`data` folder, if you want to use the code as is. All the behavioural
(anaonymised) and modelling data can be found in the OSF repo. Further
detail about the data are found under the `README.md` file in the `data`
folder.

The OSF repository is here: <https://osf.io/h3t52/>
